    <h1> The Philosophy of Ruby </h1>

    <p>
      The progamming language Ruby is widely used in web development (thanks to
      the Ruby on Rails). However, as a universal purpose language, its usage
      is <em>not</em> limited to the web. This language itself has many interesting
      features that are designed with so called 
      <strong> philosophy of Ruby </strong>.
