    <h1> The Philosophy of Ruby </h1>

    <p>
      The progamming language <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org"> Ruby </a>
      is widely used in web development (thanks to
      <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"> Ruby on Rails </a>). However, as a 
      universal purpose language, its usage
      is <em>not</em> limited to the web. This language itself has many interesting
      features that are designed with so called
      <strong> philosophy of Ruby </strong>.
