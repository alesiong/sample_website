    <h1> The Philosophy of Ruby </h1>

    <p>
      The progamming language <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>
      is widely used in web development (thanks to
      <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>). However, as a 
      universal purpose language, its usage
      is <em>not</em> limited to the web. This language itself has many interesting
      features that are designed with so called <strong>philosophy of Ruby</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2> Features </h2>

    <h3> Everything is an object </h3>
    <p>
      In Ruby, everything you see, you can operate is actually an <strong>object</strong>.
      Not only a string, an integer, a class itself and even the scope you run your
      <em>main script</em> is also an object.

    <h3> Grammar Sugar </h3>

    <h2> Application </h2>

    <h3> Meta-Programming </h3>
